Three Card Monte
Create a program that allows the user to play the game Three Card Monte. The player places a
bet and then guesses the location of the queen in a set of three cards.
Create the following functions for your program:
1. get_users_bet(money) – Pass in the user’s total money. Display the amount of
money to the user, then prompt the user to enter their bet. Check that the user’s entry is
valid and is a positive value less than or equal to the amount of money they have. Return
the valid amount.
2. get_users_choice() – Display three cards face down with numbers 1, 2, and 3.
Prompt the user to choose a card. Check that the user’s choice is a number between 1-3
and return that value.
3. display_queen_loc(queen_loc) – Pass in the location of the queen. Display
the three cards face up to show the location of the queen ‘Q’, the other two cards should
display ‘K’.
In your main function, have the user start the game with $100. Hide the queen in one of three
places by randomizing its location with a value between 1 and 3. Prompt the user to enter an
amount to bet (check that the user has enough money, otherwise tell them that it is invalid).
Then prompt the user to enter their guess for where the queen is hidden. If it is a match, then the
user receives double their bet. Display the location of the queen and tell the user if they were
correct or not. Repeat the game until the user runs out of money or decides to quit.

Notes:
1. Place your name, date, and a brief description in a comment block at the top of your
program. Add brief comments in your program to describe sections of code (you should
not have a comment describing every single line).
2. Your code should be defined within the functions.
3. Use the check_input module provided on Canvas to check the user’s input for invalid
values. Add the .py file to your project folder to use the functions. Examples using the
module is provided in a reference document on Canvas.
4. Use the random module to generate your random numbers. Examples for generating
random numbers is provided in a reference document on Canvas.
5. No need to create extra functions or add lists to your code.
6. Please read through the Coding Standards reference document on Canvas for guidelines
on how to name your variables and to format your program.
7. Thoroughly test your program before submitting:
a. Make sure the game re-randomizes the location of the queen every round.
b. Make sure that the user cannot enter an invalid input for the bet (must be between
1 and the user’s remaining money).
c. Make sure that the user cannot enter an invalid input for the guess (1-3).
d. Make sure that the queen is displayed at the correct location.
e. Make sure that the game accurately reports whether the user chose the correct
location of the queen.
f. Make sure that the user gains the amount of the bet when they win and takes away
the amount of the bet when they lose.
g. Make sure the game ends when the user is out of money or when the user decides
to quit
